# Traffic Crash Data Visualization (R)

## Objective
This project explores traffic crash data from the City of Cincinnati to identify patterns related to crash frequency, severity, location, and environmental conditions. The goal is to use data visualization to better understand factors that may impact road safety in the Cincinnati area, particularly around the University of Cincinnati.

## Data Source
Traffic Crash Reports from Cincinnati Open Data (Cincinnati Police Department).  
Each record represents a reported motor vehicle crash, including location, severity, date, weather conditions, and road characteristics.

## Tools Used
- R
- ggplot2
- Data visualization techniques
- Exploratory data analysis

## Key Visualizations & Findings
- **Crashes by Day of the Week:** Fridays have the highest number of crashes, while Sundays have the lowest.
- **Crash Severity by Day:** Crash severity proportions are relatively consistent across days of the week.
- **Geographic Patterns:** Higher crash density is observed around intersections south of the University of Cincinnati, particularly near McMillan and Calhoun Street.
- **Weather Conditions:** Most crashes occur during clear weather, though higher injury proportions appear during sleet and hail conditions.
